# Affiliate Link Scraper - 2-Day MVP

A comprehensive creator onboarding system that automatically discovers and extracts affiliate links across multiple social media platforms, turning hours of manual work into seconds of automated intelligence.

## Project Overview

This system automates the traditionally labor-intensive process of creator onboarding by automatically discovering affiliate links, brand partnerships, and product recommendations from a creator's social media presence. Built with a focus on the 80/20 principle - capturing 80% of the value with 20% of the complexity.

### What This System Does

- **Multi-Platform Discovery**: Automatically searches across 6+ platforms (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, Linktree, Beacons) to find affiliate links
- **Intelligent Link Extraction**: Discovers affiliate links from bio links, post captions, video descriptions, and other content
- **Link Intelligence**: Expands shortened URLs, detects affiliate parameters, identifies brands, and classifies link types
- **Deduplication Engine**: Smart consolidation of duplicate links found across different platforms
- **Creator Intelligence**: Generates actionable insights about creator value, platform usage, and business potential
- **Self-Service Onboarding Flow**: Frontend interface allowing creators to import all their links automatically

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of three main components:

### 1. Backend Discovery Engine (`/src/`)
- **Multi-Platform Extractors**: Individual scrapers for each platform (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)
- **Universal Orchestrator**: Coordinates parallel extraction across all platforms
- **Link Processing Pipeline**: URL expansion, affiliate detection, brand identification
- **Intelligence Layer**: Deduplication, creator analysis, and competitive insights

### 2. Creator Onboarding Frontend (`/creator-onboarding/`)
- **Next.js Application**: React-based self-service onboarding interface
- **Real-time Progress**: Live updates showing discovery progress across platforms
- **Link Management**: Review, edit, and select discovered links
- **Integration Ready**: API endpoints for importing data to external systems

### 3. Documentation & Testing (`/documentation/`)
- Comprehensive implementation guides
- Testing checklists and validation procedures
- Technical specifications and API documentation

## Current Limitations and Known Issues

### Platform-Specific Limitations
- **Instagram**: Limited by anti-bot measures, bio link extraction may be inconsistent
- **TikTok**: Platform restrictions may affect success rates
- **Twitter/X**: Relies on Nitter proxy which may be unreliable
- **Rate Limits**: Some platforms have strict rate limiting that affects batch processing

### Technical Limitations
- **Authentication**: Currently focused on publicly available data only
- **Real-time Data**: Some platforms may show cached or delayed information
- **JavaScript-Heavy Sites**: Some modern sites may not render properly in headless browsers
- **Mobile vs Desktop**: Different layouts may affect extraction reliability

### Data Quality Issues
- **Link Validation**: Some discovered links may be inactive or expired
- **Brand Detection**: May miss newer brands or misspelled brand names
- **Duplicate Detection**: Complex redirect chains may not always be properly handled

## Future Improvements

### Testing and Reliability
- **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Need to add comprehensive automated tests to prevent data flow issues like we recently experienced with the extraction pipeline
- **Integration Testing**: Improve end-to-end testing of the discovery flow from frontend to backend
- **Error Handling**: Better recovery mechanisms for partial failures

### Platform Improvements
- **Instagram Extractor Reliability**: Update the Instagram extraction logic to handle the platform's evolving anti-bot measures more effectively
- **YouTube Enhancements**: Expand video description parsing to catch more affiliate mentions
- **New Platform Support**: Add support for LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Snapchat

### Data Quality Enhancements
- **Link Validation**: Add better validation of discovered links since they will be displayed in a frontend grid of cards and need to be more reliable overall
- **Real-time Verification**: Implement link checking to ensure discovered URLs are active and accessible
- **Brand Database**: Expand the brand recognition database with more retailers and affiliate programs

### User Experience
- **Batch Import UI**: Frontend interface for processing multiple creators
- **Link Editing**: Enhanced editing capabilities for discovered links
- **Export Options**: Multiple export formats (CSV, JSON, direct API integration)
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Usage statistics and success rate tracking

### Performance and Scale
- **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis-based caching for frequently accessed creator data
- **Background Processing**: Move heavy extraction work to background job queues
