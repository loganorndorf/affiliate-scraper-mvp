# AI Code Generation Prompts
## Copy-Paste Ready Prompts for Each Component

## Prompt 1: Instagram Scraper

```
Create a TypeScript class called InstagramScraper using Puppeteer that scrapes Instagram profiles and posts without authentication. Requirements:

1. Use Puppeteer with these specific settings:
   - Headless mode
   - Mobile iPhone user agent
   - 390x844 viewport
   - Disable GPU and sandbox for performance

2. Implement these methods:
   - initialize(): Set up browser and page
   - scrapeProfile(username: string): Get profile data including follower count, bio, post count
   - scrapePosts(username: string, limit: number = 30): Get recent posts with captions and engagement
   - close(): Clean up browser

3. Handle follower count formatting:
   - Convert "10.5K" to 10500
   - Convert "1.5M" to 1500000
   - Handle regular numbers with commas

4. For each post, extract:
   - Caption text
   - Hashtags (regex: #\w+)
   - Mentions (regex: @[\w.]+)
   - Likes and comments count
   - Post ID and URL
   - Timestamp

5. Error handling:
   - Catch rate limiting (429 errors)
   - Handle private accounts
   - Timeout after 30 seconds
   - Return structured error objects

6. Use these TypeScript interfaces:
interface AthleteProfile {
  username: string;
  fullName: string;
  bio: string;
  followerCount: number;
  postCount: number;
  isVerified: boolean;
}

interface Post {
  id: string;
  caption: string;
  likes: number;
  comments: number;
  hashtags: string[];
  mentions: string[];
}

Include delays between actions to avoid rate limiting. Make it production-ready with proper error handling.
```

## Prompt 2: Affiliate Detection Engine

```
Create a TypeScript class called AffiliateDetector that identifies affiliate content in social media posts. Requirements:

1. Detect these affiliate signals:
   - Discount codes (patterns like "CODE: ATHLETE20", "use SUMMER20", "save with FITFAM")
   - Brand mentions (check against provided brand list)
   - Promo language ("link in bio", "swipe up", "check out", "get yours")
   - Affiliate hashtags (#ad, #sponsored, #partner)
   - Affiliate URLs (amazon.com?tag=, amzn.to, click.linksynergy.com)

2. Use these detection patterns:
const DISCOUNT_PATTERNS = [
  /(?:code|promo|discount)[\s:]*([A-Z0-9]{4,20})/gi,
  /use\s+([A-Z0-9]{4,20})\s+(?:for|to\s+get)/gi,
  /save\s+(?:with\s+)?([A-Z0-9]{4,20})/gi
];

const BRANDS = ['Nike', 'Adidas', 'Gymshark', 'Lululemon', ...];

3. Calculate confidence scores:
   - Explicit #ad = 95% confidence
   - Discount code found = 90% confidence
   - Brand + promo language = 75% confidence
   - Multiple signals = additive boost
   - Return 0-100 score

4. Return this structure:
interface AffiliateDetection {
  type: 'discount_code' | 'brand_mention' | 'promo_text' | 'hashtag';
  value: string;
  confidence: number;
  brand?: string;
  context?: string;
}

5. Implement methods:
   - detectAffiliates(post: Post): AffiliateDetection[]
   - detectDiscountCodes(text: string): AffiliateDetection[]
   - detectBrandMentions(text: string, mentions: string[]): AffiliateDetection[]
   - calculateOverallConfidence(detections: AffiliateDetection[]): number

6. Focus on high precision - better to miss some than have false positives.

Make it fast and accurate for real-time processing.
```

## Prompt 3: Express API Server

```

2. Implement these endpoints:

POST /api/analyze
- Body: { username: string }
- Process: 
  1. Check cache first (data/cache/{username}.json)
  2. If not cached or expired (>1 hour):
     - Run Instagram scraper
     - Run affiliate detector
     - Generate summary
     - Save to cache
  3. Return AnalysisReport
- Error handling with proper status codes

GET /api/status
- Return { status: 'healthy', timestamp: Date }

GET /api/cache/:username
- Return cached data if exists
- 404 if not found

3. Implement caching:
   - Save to data/cache/ as JSON files
   - Include timestamp
   - Expire after 1 hour
   - Return cached data instantly

4. Structure responses like:
{
  success: boolean,
  data?: AnalysisReport,
  error?: { message: string, code: string },
  cached: boolean,
  timestamp: Date
}

5. Error handling:
   - Rate limiting: 429 with retry-after header
   - Not found: 404 with helpful message
   - Server error: 500 with error ID
   - Validation error: 400 with details

6. Add request logging with timestamp, method, path, duration

Include middleware for request timing and error handling. Make it production-ready.

## How to Use These Prompts

### For Best Results:

1. **Use with Claude 3.5 or GPT-4**: These models understand the context better
2. **Provide Context**: Start with "I'm building a 2-day MVP for affiliate detection"
3. **Iterate**: If the first output isn't perfect, ask for specific improvements
4. **Combine Outputs**: Use multiple prompts together for the complete system

### Prompt Chaining Example:

```
First: "Use Prompt 1 to create the scraper"
Then: "Now use Prompt 2 to create the detector that works with this scraper"
Then: "Create the analyzer class that combines these two components"
Finally: "Create the web interface that calls the analyzer"
```

### Customization:

Feel free to modify these prompts based on:
- Specific requirements you discover
- Performance constraints
- Additional features needed
- Feedback from testing

### Testing Each Component:

After generating each component:
1. Test it in isolation first
2. Fix any syntax errors
3. Verify it meets requirements
4. Then integrate with other components

Remember: These prompts are optimized for quick generation of working code, not perfect production code. You'll need to refine and optimize after the initial generation.
