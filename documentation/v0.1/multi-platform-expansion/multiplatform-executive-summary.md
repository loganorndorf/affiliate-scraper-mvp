## The Demo Flow

### Old Demo (Linktree Only)
```
You: "Here's Cristiano's Linktree links"
Friend: "Cool, what about creators without Linktree?"
You: "..."
```

### New Demo (Universal)
```
You: "Name any creator"
Friend: "MrBeast"
You: *runs discovery*
"No Linktree, but found 47 affiliate links across YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter.
Perfect candidate for Faves. Total reach: 350M followers."
Friend: "Wait, you found links without Linktree?"
You: "I can find links from anywhere. Faves can onboard anyone."
```

## Critical Success Factors

### Must Have (Core Value)
âœ… Finds links from 3+ platforms
âœ… Works for non-Linktree creators
âœ… Deduplicates correctly
âœ… <60 second processing

### Should Have (Full Value)
âœ… TikTok + YouTube working
âœ… Intelligence recommendations
âœ… Competitor detection
âœ… <30 second processing

### Nice to Have (Wow Factor)
âœ… 6+ platforms checked
âœ… Website discovery
âœ… Historical tracking
âœ… <20 second processing

## Risk Mitigation

### If TikTok Blocks You
- Focus on YouTube (more valuable anyway)
- Still have Linktree + YouTube + Twitter

### If Time Runs Out
- Minimum: TikTok + Orchestrator (2 hours)
- Shows multi-platform concept
- Still valuable for demo

### If Everything Breaks
- Fall back to Linktree + YouTube
- Still shows expansion beyond single platform
- Explain the vision even if code isn't perfect

## The Strategic Insight

**Your friend is building Faves to compete with Linktree.**

**The problem**: Creators are locked into their current platform

**Your solution**: Universal discovery that can:
1. **Migrate from competitors**: "Moving from Linktree? We'll grab everything"
2. **Onboard new creators**: "No link aggregator? We'll find all your links"
3. **Show the opportunity**: "You have 30 links scattered everywhere"

## Talking Points for Demo

### The Technology
- "Checks 6 platforms in parallel"
- "Deduplicates intelligently"
- "Finds links competitors miss"
- "Works without authentication"

### The Business Value
- "Onboard ANY creator, not just Linktree users"
- "See who's using competitors"
- "Find creators who need link aggregation"
- "Import everything automatically"

### The Competitive Edge
