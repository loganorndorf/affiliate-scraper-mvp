# Quick Start Action Plan
## Your 2-Day Build Schedule

## Before You Start

### Mindset Shift
- ‚ùå **NOT** building a perfect scraping system
- ‚úÖ **ARE** building an extraction tool that saves 3 hours per athlete
- ‚ùå **NOT** fighting Instagram's anti-scraping
- ‚úÖ **ARE** extracting from Linktree/Beacons (easy wins)
- ‚ùå **NOT** making a formal pitch
- ‚úÖ **ARE** casually showing something useful

### Success Definition
If you can extract 15+ affiliate links from Cristiano Ronaldo's Linktree in 20 seconds and output clean JSON, you've succeeded. Everything else is bonus.

## Day 1: Morning (4 hours)

### Hour 1: Setup & First Win
```bash
# 1. Create project (10 min)
mkdir athlete-onboarding-automation
cd athlete-onboarding-automation
npm init -y
npm install puppeteer axios
npm install -D typescript ts-node @types/node

# 2. Create basic structure (5 min)
mkdir src output

# 3. Quick Linktree test (45 min)
# Create test file and verify Puppeteer works
# Goal: Print Ronaldo's Linktree links to console
```

**Success Checkpoint**: See link titles from linktr.ee/cristiano in your console

### Hour 2-3: Linktree Extractor
- Build proper LinktreeExtractor class
- Add error handling
- Test with 3 different Linktree profiles
- Save results to JSON

**Success Checkpoint**: Extract 20+ links from a Linktree and save as JSON

### Hour 4: URL Expansion
- Build LinkExpander class
- Expand bit.ly, amzn.to links
- Detect affiliate parameters
- Test with real links from Linktree

**Success Checkpoint**: Turn shortened URLs into full Amazon/brand links

---

## Day 1: Afternoon (4 hours)

### Hour 5: Beacons Support
- Add BeaconsExtractor (similar to Linktree)
- Test with athletes who use Beacons
- Handle different layout

**Success Checkpoint**: Extract from both Linktree and Beacons

### Hour 6: Brand Detection
- Create brand dictionary (50+ sports brands)
- Detect brands from URLs and titles
- Normalize brand names

**Success Checkpoint**: Identify Nike, Adidas, etc. from links

### Hour 7: Instagram Bio (Optional)
- Try to get bio link from Instagram
- If it fails quickly, move on
- This is nice-to-have, not critical

**Success Checkpoint**: Get Linktree URL from Instagram bio (if possible)

### Hour 8: Integration
- Build main orchestrator
- Connect all pieces
- Test full pipeline with 1 athlete

**Success Checkpoint**: Input "cristiano" ‚Üí Output complete JSON

---

## Day 2: Morning (4 hours)

### Hour 1-2: Polish Pipeline
- Add better error handling
- Improve JSON output format
- Add summary statistics
- Handle edge cases

**Success Checkpoint**: Clean JSON output ready for database

### Hour 3-4: Test with Real Athletes
Test these athletes in order:
1. cristiano (most links)
2. therock (complex business)
3. kingjames (multiple brands)
4. patrickmahomes5 (NFL gear)
5. [find one more athlete]

**Success Checkpoint**: 4 out of 5 athletes processed successfully

---

## Day 2: Afternoon (4 hours)

### Hour 5-6: Performance & Reliability
- Optimize for speed (parallel URL expansion)
- Add retry logic for failures
- Improve brand detection accuracy
- Cache results locally

**Success Checkpoint**: Process athlete in <30 seconds reliably

### Hour 7: Documentation
- Create simple README
- Document JSON output format
- Add usage examples
- Note any limitations

**Success Checkpoint**: Your friend could run it without you

### Hour 8: Final Testing
- Clear all cache
- Run fresh extraction for all test athletes
- Verify JSON outputs
- Time the entire process
- Prepare backup JSON files

**Success Checkpoint**: Ready to show

## The Casual Demo Plan

### The Setup (Day 2, Evening)
Text your friend: "Hey, remember you mentioned spending hours on athlete onboarding? Built something that might help. Want to see?"

### The Demo (5 minutes max)
1. **Share screen** showing terminal
2. **Type**: `npm run extract cristiano`
3. **Wait** 20 seconds while it runs
4. **Show** the JSON output
5. **Say**: "This found 23 affiliate links in 20 seconds. Normally takes you what, 3 hours?"
6. **Let them respond**
7. **If interested**: "Want to try another athlete?"

### Expected Reactions & Responses

**"How accurate is this?"**
> "About 80-90% for Linktree links. The stuff in their bio is basically perfect. Instagram posts are harder but we can work on that."

**"What about other platforms?"**
> "Built it for Instagram + Linktree first since that's most common. Can add TikTok/YouTube next if this is useful."

**"Can this integrate with our system?"**
> "It outputs clean JSON. Should drop right into your database. What format do you need?"

**"This is interesting..."**
> "Cool, want me to run your top 10 athletes and send you the data? We can see what you're missing."

---

## Emergency Pivots

### If Linktree scraping fails
‚Üí Focus on URL expansion and affiliate detection from pasted links

### If everything is broken
‚Üí Show pre-extracted JSON files and explain the concept

### If they're not interested
‚Üí "No worries, was fun to build anyway. Let me know if needs change."

### If they want it immediately
‚Üí "Let me clean it up and add some error handling. Can have it production-ready in a few days."

---

## Critical Reminders

1. **Linktree is 80% of the value** - If only this works, you still win
2. **Don't fight Instagram** - It will block you, that's OK
3. **Partial data is fine** - 15 links is better than 0
4. **JSON output is enough** - They have their own UI
5. **30 seconds vs 3 hours** - This is your value prop

## Your First Command

Right now, create the project:

```bash
mkdir athlete-onboarding-automation && cd athlete-onboarding-automation && npm init -y && npm install puppeteer axios && echo "console.log('Ready to build!')" > index.js && node index.js
```

If you see "Ready to build!" - you're ready to start. Good luck! üöÄ
