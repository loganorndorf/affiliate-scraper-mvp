## Usage Instructions

### For Best Results:

1. **Start with Setup** - Database schema and Next.js shell first
2. **Build Core Pages** - Landing and creator dashboard
3. **Add Visualizations** - Charts and metrics
4. **Polish** - Animations, mobile, exports

### Quick Test Commands:
```bash
# Start development
npm run dev
